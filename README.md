# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Survival Analysis

A complete survival analysis project using Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves, Cox Proportional Hazards Model, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal of this project is to understand survival patterns and identify key factors affecting patient outcomes.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes a clinical dataset of breast cancer patients to estimate survival probability over time.  
It uses statistical survival analysis techniques to:

- Compute survival probability  
- Compare survival across patient groups  
- Identify significant risk factors  
- Visualize long-term survival trends

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Lifelines (Survival Analysis Library)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Techniques
### ✔ Kaplan-Meier Curve  
- Estimates survival function  
- Shows probability of surviving over time  

### ✔ Cox Proportional Hazards Model  
- Identifies significant risk factors  
- Calculates hazard ratios  
- Predicts the effect of variables on survival  

### ✔ Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Distribution plots  
- Box plots  
- Correlation analysis

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset  
2. Performed basic EDA  
3. Generated Kaplan-Meier curves for:
   - Age groups  
   - Tumor stage  
   - Treatment types  
4. Built a Cox model to identify important predictors  
5. Visualized survival trends and insights
